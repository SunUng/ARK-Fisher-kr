For the script to function correctly please change the following:

```cmd
cd C:\steam\steamapps\common\ARK\ShooterGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor
```
Check if a file called "GameUserSettings.ini" exists by typing:
```cmd
dir
```
Once the config file "GameUserSettings.ini" is located in the working directory, open it with:
```cmd
GameUserSettings.ini
```
Now we locate and replace:
```json
FullscreenMode
UIScaling
```
with:
```json
FullscreenMode=1
UIScaling=1.000000
```
Game requires restart for settings to take effect!
Ensure to take note of the current settings so you don't lose them.

If none of the above work, try reset the game settings to default.
